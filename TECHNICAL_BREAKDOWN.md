# Technical Breakdown: Sports Reels Generator

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **UI Components**: 
  - Custom Reel component for video playback
  - Swiper.js for carousel functionality
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Server Components for static content
  - Client Components for interactive elements
  - Lazy loading for videos
  - Image optimization

### 2. Backend Architecture
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for serverless functions
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for script generation
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for video storage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks

### 3. Data Flow
1. User inputs celebrity name
2. Frontend sends request to `/api/reels`
3. Backend generates script using OpenAI
4. Video is generated and stored in S3
5. Signed URLs are generated for video access
6. Response is sent back to frontend
7. Frontend displays video with script overlay
